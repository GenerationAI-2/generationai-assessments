## Overview

The **AI Board Governance Diagnostic** is a focused assessment tool that helps boards demonstrate reasonable oversight of AI risks before regulators, shareholders, or incidents put it to the test.

**Core Message:**
> "Directors are personally accountable for AI governance. 'We didn't understand it' is not a defence."

**Key Value Proposition:**
- Takes under 5 minutes
- 13 strategic questions (no technical knowledge required)
- Not a compliance audit — it's a governance readiness tool
- Reveals both risks and missed opportunities

---

## Positioning & Target Audience

### Who It's For

- **Board chairs and directors**
- **CEOs and executives** reporting to boards
- **Company secretaries** and governance professionals
- **Risk and audit committee members**
- **Independent directors** with fiduciary responsibilities

### What You'll Get

1. **Board AI Governance Score (0-100)**
2. **Director readiness level** (Weak/Emerging/Developing/Mature)
3. **Top 3 governance gaps** requiring board attention
4. **Regulatory exposure indicators**
5. **Competitive governance position**
6. **Prioritised board actions**

### Why Now

- AI incidents are increasing, and boards are being held accountable
- Regulators are developing AI-specific governance expectations
- Shareholders are asking harder questions at AGMs
- Competitors with strong AI governance are pulling ahead
- The window for "we're still learning" has closed

### 13 Governance Questions

Each question uses a **6-point scale** (scored 0-5, where 5 = best governance, 0 = absent governance).

| Q# | Area | Key | Question |
|----|------|-----|----------|
| **Q1** | Board Risk Awareness | `q1_board_risk` | Can your board clearly explain the top 3 AI risks specific to your business? |
| **Q2** | Oversight & Accountability | `q2_oversight` | Who has formal responsibility for AI governance in your organisation? |
| **Q3** | Risk Appetite | `q3_risk_appetite` | Has your board defined boundaries or principles for acceptable AI use? |
| **Q4** | Strategic Integration | `q4_strategic` | How is AI considered in your organisation's strategy? |
| **Q5** | Policy & Controls | `q5_policy` | Which best describes your organisation's AI governance policy framework? |
| **Q6** | Risk Oversight | `q6_risk_reporting` | How often does the board receive AI-related risk reporting? |
| **Q7** | Stakeholder Accountability | `q7_stakeholder` | If a regulator, customer, or shareholder asked how AI is governed, how confident would your board be? |
| **Q8** | Incident Preparedness | `q8_incident` | If an AI decision caused material harm, could the board demonstrate reasonable oversight? |
| **Q9** | Third-Party AI Risk | `q9_vendor` | Does your board know which third parties use AI on your data or processes? |
| **Q10** | Board Development | `q10_development` | What steps has the board taken to build its AI governance capability? |

## Scoring System

### Scoring Formula

```
Raw Score = Sum of all 13 question scores (0-65)
Final Score = (Raw Score ÷ 65) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Q1: 3 points
- Q2: 2 points
- Q3: 4 points
- ... (10 more questions)
- **Raw Total:** 42 points
- **Final Score:** (42 ÷ 65) × 100 = **64.6** → rounds to **65/100**

### Maturity Bands

| Score Range | Band Label | Risk Profile |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| **76-100** | **Mature Governance** | Low risk - Strong oversight with clear accountability |
| **51-75** | **Developing Governance** | Medium risk - Meaningful steps taken, gaps remain |
| **26-50** | **Emerging Governance** | High risk - Fragmented, mostly informal governance |
| **0-25** | **Weak Governance** | Critical risk - Little or no governance in place |

### Band Narratives

**Mature Governance (76–100)**
> Your board demonstrates strong AI oversight with clear accountability, documented policies, and regular scenario planning. You're well placed to meet regulatory expectations and maintain stakeholder trust. The focus now is on staying vigilant as AI evolves, refreshing training, and ensuring governance frameworks remain agile.

**Developing Governance (51–75)**
> Your board has taken meaningful steps toward AI governance, with policies and oversight emerging, but gaps remain. While directors are building capability, evidence of oversight is inconsistent. To move forward, formalise reporting, strengthen decision records, and prepare for regulatory scrutiny. Momentum exists — now deepen the foundations.

**Emerging Governance (26–50)**
> Your board has some awareness of AI risks but governance is fragmented and mostly informal. Risk appetite is unclear, oversight is sporadic, and vendor exposure isn't fully tracked. Directors are vulnerable if challenged on their fiduciary duties. Urgent work is needed to build basic policies, accountability, and training.

**Weak Governance (0–25)**
> Your board has little or no AI governance in place. Directors face personal liability if an AI-related incident occurs, as there is no evidence of oversight or boundaries. This is a critical risk position. Immediate action is required to establish ownership, policy frameworks, and board-level visibility.

### Status & Risk Level Mapping

Each question score maps to a status and risk level:

| Score | Status | Risk Level | Color |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| **5** | Strong | Low | Green |
| **4** | Good | Low | Green |
| **3** | Developing | Medium | Orange |
| **2** | Weak | Medium | Orange |
| **1** | Poor | High | Red |
| **0** | Absent | Critical | Red |

## Known Issues & Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ API fully implemented and tested
- ✅ Frontend fully implemented
- ✅ PDF generation working
- ✅ Email delivery configured

### Development Notes

1. **Airtable Currently Disabled**
   - EventTarget compatibility issue in Azure Functions runtime
   - TODO: Re-enable once SDK updated or migrate to REST API

2. **PDF Generation**
   - Uses Puppeteer + @sparticuz/chromium for serverless
   - Premium EP1 plan required for memory (75-150 NZD/month)
   - Shared across all assessment tools to optimize cost

3. **Email Delivery**
   - Uses Azure Logic App (not direct SendGrid)
   - PDF attached as base64
   - Fallback: Development mode continues without email

4. **Local Development**
   - PDFs saved to `pdfs/` directory in development
   - Email not required for local testing
