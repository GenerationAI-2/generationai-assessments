## 1. QUESTION-BY-QUESTION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Q1: Leadership & Ownership

**Score 4:** The role needs real authority. Otherwise this is leadership theatre, not leadership action.

**Score 3:** Assign one leader with clear authority, budget, and mandate.

**Score 2:** This indecision costs more than any wrong decision would.

**Score 1:** Assign an owner within days, not months.

---

### Q2: Strategic Integration

**Score 4:** Document the strategy to convert conversation into coordinated action.

**Score 3:** Move from planning to pilots immediately.

**Score 2:** Without formal inclusion in strategy, AI adoption will remain scattered and ineffective.

**Score 1:** This absence isn't neutral, it's an active decision to fall behind.

**Score 0:** Begin with a leadership briefing on what AI means for your sector, otherwise you're planning for yesterday's market.

---

### Q3: Cultural Readiness

**Score 4:** Support these early adopters visibly to accelerate cultural shift across the organisation.

**Score 3:** Address the fear directly with clear messaging about augmentation, not automation.

**Score 2:** Start with visible, low-risk use cases that make daily work easier.

**Score 1:** Start with listening sessions, not technology rollouts.

**Score 2:** You're one screenshot or accidental disclosure away from crisis.

**Score 1:** Act within days, not weeks, to assess risk and reassert control.

**Score 0:** Start with a discovery exercise to understand your true exposure before incidents occur.

---

### Q6: Governance & Risk Management

**Score 0:** Start with basic legal review, ignorance multiplies penalties.

### Q8: Resources & Investment

**Score 4:** Move quickly, the gap between approval and action is where many initiatives lose steam.

**Score 3:** Consider starting with smaller investments that don't need sign-off, build momentum while bureaucracy catches up.

**Score 2:** Set a decision deadline or risk permanent delay.

**Score 1:** Even small pilot budgets would signal more readiness than zero investment.

**Score 4:** Periodic audits and tighter controls on new tools will help maintain this confidence over time.

**Score 3:** Formalise your guidance before an incident forces the issue.

**Score 2:** You'll need to act quickly to contain and correct.

---

### Q10: Opportunity Mapping

**Score 4:** Organisations at this stage often benefit from structured roadmap support to accelerate traction.

**Score 3:** A focused opportunity scan typically reveals far more upside than initially expected.

**Score 2:** Strategic clarity, even in one function, can unlock momentum and build confidence.

**Score 1:** Start by identifying one area where time, cost, or accuracy could be improved.
