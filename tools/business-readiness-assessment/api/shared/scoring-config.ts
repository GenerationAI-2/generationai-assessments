    q1_ownership: {
      type: "single_choice",
      responses: {
        "opt_5": {
          score: 5,
          label: "Clear ownership at executive level with visible leadership",
          playback: "You told us AI ownership sits clearly at executive level and is actively driving decisions.",
          interpretation: "This is best-practice leadership. Ownership is visible, strategic, and aligned to business outcomes. AI is treated as a capability, not a tech project. You're positioned to scale safely and confidently."
        },
        "opt_4": {
          score: 4,
          label: "Assigned to senior leader in IT or Operations",
          playback: "You said a senior leader owns AI, but it's not widely visible across the organisation.",
          interpretation: "You have an owner, but they're not empowered. Without budget, mandate, or visible CEO backing, ownership becomes a side project. The role needs real authority. Otherwise this is leadership theatre, not leadership action."
        },
        "opt_3": {
          score: 3,
          label: "Shared interest across leaders but no single owner",
          playback: "You told us ownership currently sits with a technical or innovation team, not the business.",
          interpretation: "This is the classic mistake, treating AI as IT's problem. When technology teams own transformation, you get impressive pilots that never scale. Business leaders avoid accountability while IT struggles for relevance. Reassign to someone who owns P&L."
        },
        "opt_2": {
          score: 2,
          label: "Discussed occasionally, but not assigned",
          playback: "You said AI has been discussed by leadership, but no one owns it yet.",
          interpretation: "Leadership is aware, but paralysed. Everyone agrees someone should own it, but nobody wants the responsibility. Meanwhile, Shadow AI spreads and competitors advance. This indecision costs more than any wrong decision would."
        },
        "opt_1": {
          score: 1,
          label: "No clear ownership or intent to assign",
          playback: "You told us no one owns AI, and there's no plan to change that.",
          interpretation: "This is passive exposure. AI will still be adopted, just without guidance. Every week without ownership means deeper fragmentation. Assign an owner within days, not months."
        },
        "opt_0": {
          score: 0,
          label: "Not discussed or considered at all",
          playback: "You said you don't know whether AI ownership exists or has even been discussed.",
          interpretation: "AI is happening without any leadership oversight. No one is watching the risks, shaping the opportunities, or guiding adoption. This is an organisational blindspot, and a strategic liability."
        }
      }
    },

    q2_strategy: {
      type: "single_choice",
      responses: {
        "opt_5": {
          score: 5,
          label: "Embedded in strategic plans and actively reviewed",
          playback: "You told us AI is embedded in your strategic plans and actively reviewed at leadership level.",
          interpretation: "AI is treated as a strategic capability, not a side project. This integration means AI investments align with business outcomes, not technology experiments. You're positioned to capture value systematically rather than opportunistically."
        },
        "opt_4": {
          score: 4,
          label: "Regularly discussed at board or exec level",
          playback: "You said AI is regularly discussed at board or executive level meetings.",
          interpretation: "Leadership engagement is strong, but discussion without documentation risks drift. Until AI moves from agenda item to strategic plan, execution remains informal. Document the strategy to convert conversation into coordinated action."
        },
        "opt_3": {
          score: 3,
          label: "Included in planning documents but not acted on",
          playback: "You told us AI appears in planning documents but hasn't translated to action.",
          interpretation: "This is strategic theatre, AI is mentioned to appear current, but without execution it's just words on paper. The gap between documentation and action is where competitive advantage is lost. Move from planning to pilots immediately."
        },
        "opt_2": {
          score: 2,
          label: "Mentioned informally by leaders or managers",
          playback: "You said AI is mentioned informally by leaders but isn't part of formal planning.",
          interpretation: "AI is a talking point, not a strategic priority. Informal mentions create confusion, staff don't know if it's encouraged or just discussed. Without formal inclusion in strategy, AI adoption will remain scattered and ineffective."
        },
        "opt_1": {
          score: 1,
          label: "Not included in any planning activities",
          playback: "You told us AI isn't included in any business planning activities.",
          interpretation: "Your strategy is silent on the biggest business transformation of our time. While you plan without AI, competitors are planning with it. This absence isn't neutral, it's an active decision to fall behind."
        },
        "opt_0": {
          score: 0,
          label: "Not discussed or considered",
          playback: "You said AI hasn't been discussed or considered at strategic level.",
          interpretation: "AI is completely off your radar while reshaping every industry. This isn't just oversight, it's strategic blindness. Begin with a leadership briefing on what AI means for your sector, otherwise you're planning for yesterday's market."
        }
      }
    },

    q3_culture: {
      type: "single_choice",
      responses: {
        "opt_5": {
          score: 5,
          label: "Staff are encouraged, supported and confident using AI tools",
          playback: "You told us staff are actively encouraged, supported, and confident in using AI tools.",
          interpretation: "You've created psychological safety around AI experimentation. This cultural foundation is harder to build than any technical capability. Staff feel empowered to explore, fail, and improve. This is where sustainable transformation happens."
        },
        "opt_4": {
          score: 4,
          label: "Most staff are positive, with champions emerging",
          playback: "You said most staff are positive about AI, with champions starting to emerge across teams.",
          interpretation: "Momentum is building organically. Champions are your multiplier effect, they'll influence peers more effectively than any top-down mandate. Support these early adopters visibly to accelerate cultural shift across the organisation."
        },
        "opt_3": {
          score: 3,
          label: "Mixed responses, with some resistance or uncertainty",
          playback: "You told us there are mixed responses, with pockets of resistance and uncertainty.",
          interpretation: "This is typical and manageable. The split usually follows generational or role lines. Resistance often masks fear, fear of replacement, irrelevance, or failure. Address the fear directly with clear messaging about augmentation, not automation."
        },
        "opt_2": {
          score: 2,
          label: "Limited engagement or experimentation by staff",
          playback: "You said there's limited engagement, with little visible experimentation happening.",
          interpretation: "Staff are watching and waiting. This passive stance usually means either no permission, no tools, or no confidence. Without cultural momentum, even good tools and policies will fail. Start with visible, low-risk use cases that make daily work easier."
        },
        "opt_1": {
          score: 1,
          label: "Clear hesitation or pushback from staff",
          playback: "You told us there's clear hesitation or active pushback from staff regarding AI.",
          interpretation: "You're facing cultural headwinds. Pushback signals deeper issues, lack of trust, fear of job losses, or past failed initiatives. This resistance will sabotage any AI initiative unless addressed. Start with listening sessions, not technology rollouts."
        },
        "opt_0": {
          score: 0,
          label: "No visible engagement or signals at all",
          playback: "You said there's no visible engagement or cultural signals around AI adoption.",
          interpretation: "AI isn't even part of the conversation. This silence is concerning, it suggests either complete disconnection from market reality or active suppression of innovation. Before introducing tools, you need to reintroduce curiosity and possibility."
        }
      }
    },

    q4_enablement: {
      type: "single_choice",
      responses: {
        "opt_5": {
          score: 5,
          label: "Role-specific training and structured enablement delivered",
          playback: "You told us staff have received role-specific training with structured enablement for their AI use.",
          interpretation: "You're building capability systematically. Role-specific training means staff learn what's relevant, not generic. This targeted approach accelerates adoption and reduces risk. The investment in structured enablement will compound as staff become multipliers of capability."
        },
        "opt_4": {
          score: 4,
          label: "Formal sessions or resources provided to most teams",
          playback: "You said formal training sessions or resources have been provided to most teams.",
          interpretation: "You've made a solid start, but coverage gaps remain. \"Most teams\" means some teams are operating without guidance, often those who need it most. Complete the rollout before unguided teams create risks or fall behind."
        },
        "opt_3": {
          score: 3,
          label: "Basic guidance shared across the business",
          playback: "You told us basic guidance has been shared with staff across the organisation.",
          interpretation: "You've communicated the minimum, but basics won't build capability. Staff know the rules but not the potential. Without deeper enablement, AI use remains superficial, copying text rather than transforming workflows. Investment in proper training pays back quickly."
        },
        "opt_2": {
          score: 2,
          label: "Informal tips or peer support only",
          playback: "You said staff rely on informal tips or peer-to-peer support for AI guidance.",
          interpretation: "This creates dangerous inconsistency. One person's \"best practice\" becomes another's risk exposure. Peer learning has value, but without formal structure, myths spread faster than facts. Establish official guidance before bad habits become embedded."
        },
        "opt_1": {
          score: 1,
          label: "Told not to use AI, without alternatives",
          playback: "You told us staff have been instructed not to use AI, with no alternatives provided.",
          interpretation: "Prohibition without provision drives behaviour underground. Staff who need productivity tools will find them anyway, just without your knowledge or control. This approach guarantees Shadow AI. Provide safe alternatives or accept hidden risk."
        },
        "opt_0": {
          score: 0,
          label: "No guidance, training or enablement at all",
          playback: "You said no guidance or training has been provided to staff about AI use.",
          interpretation: "Staff are improvising in a vacuum. Without any enablement, they're learning from YouTube and ChatGPT itself. This isn't just capability gap, it's active risk creation. Every untrained user is a potential incident. Start with one-page guidance and team walkthroughs, simple beats nothing."
        }
      }
    },

    q5_shadow_ai: {
      type: "single_choice",
      responses: {
        "opt_5": {
          score: 5,
          label: "No unauthorised use – strong controls in place",
          playback: "You told us your staff are not using unapproved AI tools, and you have controls in place to ensure that.",
          interpretation: "You've established clear expectations, approved tools, and strong oversight. Shadow AI isn't just low, it's actively prevented. This reflects mature policy, communication, and trust."
        },
        "opt_4": {
          score: 4,
          label: "Minimal use in isolated cases only",
          playback: "You said unauthorised AI use is rare and limited to isolated cases.",
          interpretation: "You've achieved reasonable control, but vigilance is needed. Those \"isolated cases\" often multiply without active monitoring. Formalise your controls before exceptions become patterns."
        },
        "opt_3": {
          score: 3,
          label: "Some teams using personal accounts",
          playback: "You told us some teams are using personal AI tools or free accounts to get their work done.",
          interpretation: "This is where most organisations sit, and where risk accumulates fast. Company data is entering personal tools with no audit trail. Without intervention, this spreads from \"some teams\" to \"most teams\" within months."
        },
        "opt_2": {
          score: 2,
          label: "Widespread informal use across teams",
          playback: "You said there's widespread informal use of AI tools through free or personal accounts.",
          interpretation: "Shadow AI is active across your business. This likely includes client data in ChatGPT, IP in Claude, and no system-level tracking. You're one screenshot or accidental disclosure away from crisis."
        },
        "opt_1": {
          score: 1,
          label: "Extensive Shadow AI, no controls in place",
          playback: "You told us staff are actively using AI tools, but you have no formal tracking, tooling, or policy.",
          interpretation: "This is crisis-level exposure. Shadow AI is shaping work at scale, and leadership has no visibility. Act within days, not weeks, to assess risk and reassert control."
        },
        "opt_0": {
          score: 0,
          label: "Don't know what's being used",
          playback: "You said you don't know whether staff are using AI tools — or to what extent.",
          interpretation: "You can't protect what you can't see. Shadow AI is definitely active, and data is likely exposed. Start with a discovery exercise to understand your true exposure before incidents occur."
        }
      }
    },

    q6_governance: {
      type: "single_choice",
      responses: {
        "opt_5": {
          score: 5,
          label: "Clear AI policy and guardrails in place",
          playback: "You told us you have clear governance in place, with AI policies, approved tools, and team guidance already active.",
          interpretation: "You've built mature, enabling governance. Policies are clear, tools are approved, and staff have confidence to explore safely. This protects trust, reduces exposure, and positions you to scale capability."
        },
        "opt_4": {
          score: 4,
          label: "Working draft shared and being refined",
          playback: "You said governance is in place, but still informal or in draft form.",
          interpretation: "You're building the plane while flying it. Draft policies are better than nothing, but staff are making their own calls in the meantime. One team might paste client data into free tools, while another refuses to use AI at all. Finish what you've started, consistency requires completion."
        },
        "opt_3": {
          score: 3,
          label: "Basic rules or principles communicated",
          playback: "You told us governance has been discussed, but there's nothing formal in place.",
          interpretation: "Governance by rumour is dangerous. Some staff think AI is banned, others think it's encouraged, most don't know. This confusion guarantees inconsistent behaviour and hidden risk. Document the basics immediately, even a one-page guide beats nothing."
        },
        "opt_2": {
          score: 2,
          label: "Informal expectations only",
          playback: "You said AI use is allowed, but governance hasn't yet been considered.",
          interpretation: "This is the worst position: permission without protection. Teams assume it's safe to use AI but have no guidance on what's acceptable. You're one client complaint away from discovering what's been shared, and by whom. Start by defining what's in bounds."
        },
        "opt_1": {
          score: 1,
          label: "Told not to use AI, no guidance or support",
          playback: "You told us there's been no discussion of AI governance at all.",
          interpretation: "The first incident will be your wake-up call — an AI hallucination in a client report, sensitive data showing up in model training, or a compliance inquiry you can't answer. This isn't just a policy gap, it's a leadership exposure."
        },
        "opt_0": {
          score: 0,
          label: "No guardrails or discussion at all",
          playback: "You said you don't know whether your business has any AI governance in place.",
          interpretation: "This suggests risk isn't even on the radar. Without visibility, policy, or ownership, you have no ability to detect, contain, or respond to incidents. Begin with a discovery process and a conversation at leadership level."
        }
      }
    },

          score: 5,
          label: "Fully confident — legal obligations mapped and controls in place",
          playback: "You told us you're fully confident, with legal obligations mapped and controls actively enforced.",
          interpretation: "You've done the work others avoid. Mapping obligations to controls means compliance by design, not luck. This positions you to respond confidently to regulators, auditors, or clients. Maintain this through regular reviews as AI regulations evolve rapidly."
        },
        "opt_4": {
          score: 4,
          label: "Mostly confident — risks understood and mitigated",
          playback: "You said you're mostly confident, with key risks identified and mitigation in place.",
          interpretation: "You understand the landscape but haven't mapped every detail. \"Mostly confident\" often means known unknowns remain. The gap between mostly and fully confident is where incidents hide. Close those gaps before they close on you."
        },
        "opt_3": {
          score: 3,
          label: "Somewhat confident — partial understanding and oversight",
          playback: "You told us you're somewhat confident, with partial understanding of obligations.",
          interpretation: "This uncertainty is common but dangerous. \"Somewhat confident\" in legal compliance is like being \"somewhat pregnant\", you either comply or you don't. Partial understanding leads to partial protection. Get legal clarity before an incident forces it."
        },
        "opt_2": {
          score: 2,
          label: "Not confident — limited awareness or checks",
          playback: "You said you're not confident, with limited awareness of legal obligations.",
          interpretation: "You know enough to be worried, but not enough to be safe. This honesty is valuable, it's better than false confidence. But worry without action is just anxiety. Map your obligations urgently; ignorance isn't a legal defence."
        },
        "opt_1": {
          score: 1,
          label: "Know we're likely exposed",
          playback: "You told us you know your AI use likely violates legal obligations.",
          interpretation: "You're knowingly operating outside compliance. This isn't just risk, it's liability accumulating daily. Every day of known non-compliance increases penalty severity if discovered. Remediation is cheaper than prosecution. Act immediately."
        },
        "opt_0": {
          score: 0,
          label: "Haven't considered legal or privacy risks at all",
          playback: "You said you haven't considered legal or privacy obligations related to AI use.",
          interpretation: "The law applies whether you consider it or not. Privacy Acts, and data protection laws don't require your awareness to impose penalties. You're operating blind in a minefield. Start with basic legal review, ignorance multiplies penalties."

          playback: "You told us you've fully resourced AI adoption with budget, team, and executive commitment in place.",
          interpretation: "You're backing intent with investment. This is where strategy becomes reality. With resources allocated, your focus shifts to execution quality and ROI measurement. The risk now is spreading resources too thin, maintain focus on priority use cases."
        },
        "opt_4": {
          score: 4,
          label: "Budget approved, team being assembled",
          playback: "You said budget is approved and you're building the team to deliver AI initiatives.",
          interpretation: "You've crossed the commitment threshold. Budget approval signals leadership buy-in, but team assembly is where momentum builds or stalls. Move quickly, the gap between approval and action is where many initiatives lose steam."
        },
        "opt_3": {
          score: 3,
          label: "Resources identified, approval in progress",
          playback: "You told us resources have been identified but you're still securing formal approval.",
          interpretation: "You're in the danger zone between intent and action. While approval processes grind on, competitors are already executing. Consider starting with smaller investments that don't need sign-off, build momentum while bureaucracy catches up."
        },
        "opt_2": {
          score: 2,
          label: "Considering investment, no formal commitment",
          playback: "You said you're considering investment but haven't made formal commitments yet.",
          interpretation: "This is exploration without commitment. AI requires more than curiosity, it needs dedicated resources. Without budget or team allocation, you're essentially window shopping while others are building. Set a decision deadline or risk permanent delay."
        },
        "opt_1": {
          score: 1,
          label: "No resources allocated or planned",
          playback: "You told us no resources have been allocated and none are planned for AI adoption.",
          interpretation: "You're treating AI as optional while competitors treat it as essential. No resources means no progress. This isn't just about falling behind, it's about becoming irrelevant. Even small pilot budgets would signal more readiness than zero investment."
        },
        "opt_0": {
          score: 0,
          label: "Haven't considered resourcing yet",
          playback: "You said you haven't yet considered what resources AI adoption would require.",
          interpretation: "This suggests AI isn't even on the strategic radar. While you haven't considered resourcing, your competitors are already seeing returns. Start by understanding resource requirements, you can't make informed decisions without knowing the investment needed."

          playback: "You said you're fully confident that strong technical controls are in place to prevent data exposure through AI tools.",
          interpretation: "This reflects a mature security posture. Approved tools, usage monitoring, and clear controls are working together to protect sensitive data. You're treating AI as a data processor, and managing the risks accordingly."
        },
