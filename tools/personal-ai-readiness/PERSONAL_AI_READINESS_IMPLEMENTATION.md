## Scoring System

### Scoring Formula

```
Raw Score = Sum of 11 scored question scores (0-55)
           (Q7 excluded - qualitative only)

Final Score = (Raw Score ÷ 55) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Q1: 4 points (daily use)
- Q2: 3 points (experimental)
- Q3: 4 points (yes, with custom prompts)
- Q4: 3 points (somewhat confident)
- Q5: 2 points (prefer others lead)
- Q6: 3 points (3-5 hours/week)
- Q7: 0 points (qualitative - content creation)
- Q8: 3 points (read articles occasionally)
- Q9: 4 points (self-paced online)
- Q10: 4 points (very motivated)
- Q11: 4 points (probably)
- Q12: 3 points (comfortable with caution)
- **Raw Total:** 37 points
- **Final Score:** (37 ÷ 55) × 100 = **67.3** → rounds to **67/100**

### Readiness Bands

| Score Range | Band Label | Persona | Risk Profile |
|-------------|------------|---------|--------------|
| **76-100** | **AI Leader** | Ahead of the curve | Leading others |
| **51-75** | **AI Ready** | Actively using AI | Scaling capability |
| **26-50** | **AI Curious** | Exploring but inconsistent | Critical transition point |
| **0-25** | **AI Distant** | Not engaged yet | Competitive disadvantage |

### Band Narratives

**AI Leader (76–100)**
> You're ahead of the curve, using AI strategically and ready to lead others. Your focus now should be on advanced techniques, systematic deployment, and helping your organisation capture similar value.

**AI Ready (51–75)**
> You're actively using AI and seeing results, but there's significant untapped potential. You have the foundation; now it's time to scale from individual productivity to strategic advantage.

**AI Curious (26–50)**
> You've begun exploring AI but haven't found your rhythm. You understand the concepts but lack consistent application. This is the critical transition point, with focused effort, you can quickly move from observer to practitioner.

**AI Distant (0–25)**
> You're at the starting line of AI adoption. While others are already capturing value, you haven't yet engaged meaningfully with these tools. This puts you at immediate competitive disadvantage, but also means your potential gains are the highest.

### Capability Narratives

Each band also has a **capability narrative** that provides deeper insight:

**AI Leader**
> You've embedded AI into your workflows and operate with strategic intent. You're making better decisions, saving meaningful time, and influencing others. Your next opportunity is to scale your capability across your team and organisation.

**AI Ready**
> You're using AI regularly for specific tasks and beginning to gain leverage. Your awareness is strong, your habits are forming, and you're ready to shift from experimentation to systemisation. With the right support, you can become an AI leader in your organisation.

**AI Curious**
> You occasionally experiment with AI but haven't made it part of how you work. You grasp the importance, but lack confidence and consistency. This middle ground is where many stall, you'll either commit to growth or risk falling behind.

**AI Distant**
> You haven't yet integrated AI into your workflows and lack confidence in guiding others. While this is a vulnerability, it's also your biggest growth opportunity. Small changes can drive big returns. Right now, you're exposed, and competitors are accelerating past.

## Personalization System (Tier-Based Insights)

**Unique Feature:** This assessment uses a **3-tier personalization system** to generate custom insights based on question combinations:

### 1. Usage Tier (1-5)
**Calculated from:** Q1 (Frequency) + Q2 (Approach)

**Tier Map Example:**
- `multiple_advanced` → Tier 5 (highest)
- `daily_productive` → Tier 4
- `weekly_experimental` → Tier 3
- `rarely_basic` → Tier 2
- `never_none` → Tier 1 (lowest)

**Usage Insights by Tier:**

**Tier 1:**
> You're not yet using AI meaningfully in your work. Whether due to uncertainty, policy, or habit, this leaves value on the table daily. Until AI becomes part of your workflow, you're missing easy wins in both time and quality.

**Tier 2:**
> You've started dabbling with AI tools, but use remains infrequent and surface-level. That's normal, most leaders begin here. But without deliberate practice, AI won't move from curiosity to capability.

**Tier 3:**
> You're actively exploring how AI could help, trying tools, testing prompts, but haven't yet built repeatable workflows. This is a critical stage. With structure and focus, you could rapidly move into consistent productivity gains.

**Tier 4:**
> AI plays a defined role in your weekly rhythm. You use it to streamline content, summarise material, or support decisions. These are strong habits, the next step is to expand into higher-leverage workflows and team enablement.

**Tier 5:**
> You've built AI into your core operating system, using templates, chaining tools, and saving hours each week. You're not just using AI, you're leveraging it. Your opportunity now is to scale this capability into your team or function.

### 2. Leadership Tier (1-4)
**Calculated from:** Q4 (Explain AI) + Q5 (Lead)

**Leadership Insights by Tier:**

**Tier 1:**
> You're still early in your AI leadership journey. You're unsure how to explain it, and hesitant to guide others. That's understandable, but your role is pivotal. Until leadership understands the tools, the team won't follow. This is the moment to lead by learning.

**Tier 2:**
> You grasp the potential of AI and can explain it reasonably well, but you're not yet stepping into a leadership role. That's a common gap, bridging it means moving from passive knowledge to active influence. Your team's progress will likely follow yours.

**Tier 3:**
> You're already using AI and beginning to guide others. That puts you ahead of most leaders. Your next step is clarity, clearly framing AI's value for your organisation and giving others permission to engage. This is where cultural shift begins.

**Tier 4:**
> You're confidently explaining AI's business value and already influencing how others engage with it. That's the hallmark of an AI-ready leader. Your opportunity now is to build internal capability and help your organisation embed this advantage at scale.

### 3. Learning Tier (1-4)
**Calculated from:** Q8 (Stay Informed) + Q9 (Learning Preference)

**Learning Insights by Tier:**

**Tier 1:**
> You're not currently investing time in learning about AI, and you may feel unsure where to begin. That's normal, many leaders are in the same position. But without dedicated focus, it's easy to fall further behind while others accelerate. AI capability compounds. Every week you delay learning, your competitors move further ahead. The good news? Small, structured steps can build momentum fast.

**Tier 2:**
> You're showing interest in AI and open to learning, but haven't yet found the format, time, or structure that works for you. That's common. Leaders at this stage often feel the gap but don't know how to bridge it. The key is committing to one focused pathway, even a short session can build clarity and confidence. With the right guidance, your curiosity can quickly convert to capability.

**Tier 3:**
> You're actively developing your understanding of AI and committed to expanding your capability. That positions you well to accelerate. The next step is applying that learning consistently, turning insights into new workflows and habits. You're past the passive stage. Now it's about systems, experimentation, and peer learning. We can help you scale what you've started.

**Tier 4:**
> You're deeply engaged in AI learning and already applying what you're discovering. This puts you in the top tier of proactive leaders. Your challenge now is twofold: deepening your technical literacy, and helping your team build shared capability. We recommend connecting with other AI-ready leaders and accessing advanced learning formats that stretch and sharpen your edge.

## Unique Features

### 1. Tier-Based Personalization

Unlike Board Governance (which uses fixed question interpretations), Personal AI Readiness uses **dynamic tier-based insights**:

- **Usage Tier** (5 levels): Combines frequency (Q1) + approach (Q2)
- **Leadership Tier** (4 levels): Combines explain confidence (Q4) + willingness to lead (Q5)
- **Learning Tier** (4 levels): Combines stay informed (Q8) + learning preference (Q9)

**Example:**
- User answers Q1: "daily" + Q2: "productive" → Usage Tier 4
- Report shows Tier 4 insight: "AI plays a defined role in your weekly rhythm..."

### 2. Qualitative Question (Q7)

Q7 (use cases) **doesn't contribute to score** but is used for personalization:
- "You expressed interest in **Content Creation**. Here are 3 ways to start..."

### 3. Band-Specific CTAs

Each readiness band gets a tailored next step:
- **AI Distant** → "Start with Foundations" (90-min session)
- **AI Curious** → "Build Momentum" (4-week program)
- **AI Ready** → "Scale Your Impact" (Leaders cohort)
- **AI Leader** → "Lead the Pack" (Advanced strategy)

### 4. Personal vs Organizational Focus

- **Board Governance** = Organizational oversight, director liability
- **Personal AI Readiness** = Individual capability, personal productivity

## Known Issues & Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ API fully implemented and tested
- ✅ Frontend fully implemented
- ✅ Scoring engine with tier system working
- ✅ Email delivery configured
- ⚠️ Airtable integration disabled
- ⏳ PDF template needs implementation in `pdf-template.ts`
- ✅ Workflows deployed and active

### Development Notes

1. **PDF Template Missing**
   - Function `generatePersonalAIReadinessHTML()` needs to be added to `services/pdf-generator/shared/pdf-template.ts`
   - Should follow same structure as Business Readiness template
   - Must include tier insights (usage, leadership, learning)

2. **Tier Calculation**
   - Tier maps are comprehensive (95+ mappings)
   - Handles all combinations of Q1+Q2, Q4+Q5, Q8+Q9
   - Falls back to Tier 1 if combination not found

3. **Q7 Special Handling**
   - Always scores 0 points
   - Value used for report personalization only
   - Doesn't affect band calculation

4. **Max Score**
   - Max raw score = 55 (not 60) because Q7 = 0
   - 11 scored questions × 5 points = 55
